## Guiding questions
1. What are the options for creating a user interface?
There seems to be already a well documented Electron desktop application, see [this](https://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/pc-ble-driver-js/) and [this](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-ble-driver-py) with lots of examples in which we can adapt for your use cases.

2. What factors should we consider?
We need more libraries support for the particular platform in which we are going to choose.

3. What is the platform we are aiming for (Desktop, Mobile application or Web)?

4. Is there software support for the respective platform, Android iOS Flutter React Native
